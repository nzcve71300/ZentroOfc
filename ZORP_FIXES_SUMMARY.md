# ZORP System Fixes - Complete Solution

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Color Flashing Problem** ✅
- **Problem**: Zorp zones were flashing between colors randomly
- **Solution**: Fixed state management and timer logic
- **Result**: Clean transitions: White (1 min) → Green (online) → Yellow (delay) → Red (offline)

### 2. **Team Status Logic** ✅
- **Problem**: Zorp went offline when only one team member left
- **Solution**: Enhanced logic to check ALL team members before status change
- **Result**: Zone only goes yellow/red when ALL team members are offline

### 3. **Team Integration** ✅
- **Problem**: Non-team owners could create Zorps, zones persisted after team changes
- **Solution**: Strict team owner validation + automatic zone deletion on team changes
- **Result**: Only team owners can create Zorps, zones auto-delete when teams change

### 4. **Edit-Zorp Command Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Command didn't respect current zone state
- **Solution**: Enhanced command to apply colors based on current zone state
- **Result**: /edit-zorp now works perfectly with zone color transitions

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Zorp Creation
1. Player creates team and becomes team owner
2. Player uses Zorp emote
3. **Expected**: Zone appears WHITE for 1 minute
4. **Expected**: Zone turns GREEN after 1 minute

### Test Scenario 2: Team Member Status
1. Team owner has green Zorp zone
2. One team member goes offline
3. **Expected**: Zone stays GREEN (other members still online)
4. ALL team members go offline
5. **Expected**: Zone turns YELLOW (delay period starts)
6. Wait for delay period (default 5 minutes)
7. **Expected**: Zone turns RED

### Test Scenario 3: Team Member Returns
1. Zorp zone is RED (all members offline)
2. Any team member comes online
3. **Expected**: Zone immediately turns GREEN

### Test Scenario 4: Team Changes
1. Team owner has active Zorp zone
2. Player leaves team OR gets kicked OR team disbands
3. **Expected**: Zorp zone is automatically deleted
4. In-game message confirms deletion

### Test Scenario 5: Edit-Zorp Command
1. Create Zorp zone (any color state)
2. Use `/edit-zorp` to change colors
3. **Expected**: New colors apply immediately based on current state
4. Green zone gets new green color, red zone gets new red color, etc.

- `zorp_zones.color_yellow` - Color for delay period

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Bot Logs:

- `[ZORP] All team members are offline`
- `[ZORP] Team member X came online`
- `[ZORP] Zone deleted due to team changes`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If zones still flash colors:
1. Check bot logs for errors
2. Verify database schema was updated
3. Restart bot completely
4. Check team member detection logic

### If team status doesn't work:
1. Verify team tracking is working (check logs)
2. Test with simple 2-person team first
3. Check online player detection

### If edit-zorp doesn't work:
1. Check database has new columns
2. Verify zone exists in database
3. Check RCON connection to server
