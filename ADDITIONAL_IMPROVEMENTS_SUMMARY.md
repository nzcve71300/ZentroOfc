## 📊 Expected Results

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logs

### Key Log Messages:

#### Link Command:
```
[LINK DEBUG] Found 0 existing links for Discord ID 123456789
[LINK] Brand new user 123456789 - no previous links found, proceeding with IGN check
```

#### Team Messages:
```
[ZORP FEED] Team created: PlayerName (1234)
[ZORP FEED] Team joined: PlayerName -> OwnerName's team (1234)
[ZORP FEED] Team left: PlayerName <- OwnerName's team (1234)
[ZORP] Team change detected: PlayerName created a team, ID: [1234]
```

### Check Bot Logs:
```bash
pm2 logs zentro-bot | grep -E "(LINK|ZORP FEED|TEAM)"
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If New Players Still Can't Link:
1. Check bot logs for specific error messages
2. Verify database connection is working
3. Look for "[LINK DEBUG]" messages in logs
4. Test with completely fresh Discord account

### If Team Messages Don't Appear:
1. Verify Zorp feed channel is configured
2. Check team message format detection in logs
3. Look for "[ZORP FEED]" messages in console
4. Test with actual team creation/joining in-game

### Common Issues:
- **Channel not configured**: Zorp feed channel not set up
- **Permissions**: Bot lacks permission to send to feed channel
- **Message format**: Team messages might have different format than expected
