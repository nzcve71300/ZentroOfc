# Autocomplete Display Name Update

## üéØ Changes Made

### **Updated Autocomplete Display Names:**

**Before:**
- `OUTPOST (Enable/Disable)`
- `BANDIT (Enable/Disable)`
- `CRATE-1 (Enable/Disable)`
- `CRATE-2 (Enable/Disable)`
- `CRATE-3 (Enable/Disable)`
- `CRATE-4 (Enable/Disable)`

**After:**
- `OUTPOST (ON/OFF)`
- `BANDIT (ON/OFF)`
- `CRATE-1 (ON/OFF)`
- `CRATE-2 (ON/OFF)`
- `CRATE-3 (ON/OFF)`
- `CRATE-4 (ON/OFF)`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **What Changed:**
1. **Position Display Names**: Updated to show `(ON/OFF)` instead of `(Enable/Disable)`
2. **Crate Display Names**: Updated to show `(ON/OFF)` instead of `(Enable/Disable)`
3. **Consistent Format**: All enable/disable options now use the same `(ON/OFF)` format

### **What Stayed the Same:**
- ‚úÖ **All command logic** - No changes to functionality
- ‚úÖ **All validation rules** - Same on/off validation
- ‚úÖ **All database operations** - Exactly the same
- ‚úÖ **All other options** - TIME, AMOUNT, MSG, DELAY, COOLDOWN remain unchanged

## üìù Usage Examples

### **Autocomplete Options Now Show:**
```
OUTPOST (ON/OFF)
BANDIT (ON/OFF)
CRATE-1 (ON/OFF)
CRATE-2 (ON/OFF)
CRATE-3 (ON/OFF)
CRATE-4 (ON/OFF)
```

### **Commands Work the Same:**
```
/set OUTPOST on Main Server
/set BANDIT off Main Server
/set CRATE-1 on Main Server
/set CRATE-2 off Main Server
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Consistent Display**: All enable/disable options use the same `(ON/OFF)` format
2. **Clearer Indication**: `(ON/OFF)` is more direct than `(Enable/Disable)`
3. **Better UX**: Users immediately understand these are on/off toggles
4. **Unified Interface**: All features use the same display pattern

## üöÄ Ready to Use

The autocomplete display names are now updated to show the consistent `(ON/OFF)` format for all enable/disable options, making the interface cleaner and more intuitive.
