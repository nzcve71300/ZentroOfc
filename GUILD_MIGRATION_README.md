# Zentro Bot Guild Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate all bot data from one Discord server to another while keeping the Rust server configuration unchanged.

## Overview

**Migration Details:**
- **From Discord Server:** `1376431874699825216`
- **To Discord Server:** `1413335350742614067`
- **Rust Server:** Remains unchanged (same IP, port, RCON details)

## What Gets Migrated

The migration script will move all the following data:

### Core Data
- ‚úÖ Guild record
- ‚úÖ Rust server configurations
- ‚úÖ Player accounts and links
- ‚úÖ Economy balances
- ‚úÖ Transaction history

### Shop System
- ‚úÖ Shop categories
- ‚úÖ Shop items
- ‚úÖ Shop kits
- ‚úÖ Auto-kits
- ‚úÖ Kit authorization settings

### Additional Features
- ‚úÖ Channel settings
- ‚úÖ Position coordinates
- ‚úÖ Zones
- ‚úÖ Killfeed configurations
- ‚úÖ Player statistics
- ‚úÖ Home teleport data
- ‚úÖ Player whitelists
- ‚úÖ ZORP settings
- ‚úÖ Bounty system data
- ‚úÖ Prison system data
- ‚úÖ Rider configuration
- ‚úÖ Nivaro store data

## Prerequisites

1. **Bot Access:** Ensure the bot is added to the new Discord server (`1413335350742614067`)
2. **Database Access:** Make sure you have access to the MySQL database
3. **Backup:** The migration script creates automatic backups before proceeding

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run the Migration

```bash
node run_migration.js
```

The script will:
1. Ask for confirmation before proceeding
2. Create a backup of existing data
3. Migrate all data to the new guild
4. Verify the migration was successful

### Step 2: Verify Migration

After migration, test the following in the new Discord server:

1. **Player Commands:**
   - `/link` - Link Discord account to Rust player
   - `/balance` - Check economy balance
   - `/daily` - Claim daily rewards
   - `/shop` - Access shop system

2. **Admin Commands:**
   - `/addserver` - Verify server is still configured
   - `/serverlist` - Check server status
   - `/economy` - Manage player economy

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Test any custom features your server uses
   - Verify ZORP, home teleport, bounty system, etc.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback the migration:

```bash
node rollback_migration.js
```

This will move all data back to the original Discord server.

## Important Notes

### What Stays the Same
- ‚úÖ Rust server IP and port
- ‚úÖ RCON password and settings
- ‚úÖ All player in-game data
- ‚úÖ Server configuration files

### What Changes
- üîÑ Discord server ID in the database
- üîÑ Bot will respond to commands in the new Discord server
- üîÑ All Discord-specific settings move to new server

### After Migration
1. **Remove Bot from Old Server:** Once you've verified everything works, remove the bot from the old Discord server
2. **Update Documentation:** Update any documentation that references the old server ID
3. **Notify Players:** Let your community know about the Discord server change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding in new server:**
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in the new Discord server
- Check that the bot is online and connected

**Player data missing:**
- Run the verification step in the migration script
- Check the database directly if needed

**Economy not working:**
- Verify player links are working with `/link` command
- Check that the economy table was migrated properly

### Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check guild records
SELECT * FROM guilds WHERE discord_id IN ('1376431874699825216', '1413335350742614067');

-- Check servers
SELECT rs.*, g.discord_id as guild_discord_id 
FROM rust_servers rs 
JOIN guilds g ON rs.guild_id = g.id 
WHERE g.discord_id IN ('1376431874699825216', '1413335350742614067');

-- Check players
SELECT p.*, g.discord_id as guild_discord_id 
FROM players p 
JOIN guilds g ON p.guild_id = g.id 
WHERE g.discord_id IN ('1376431874699825216', '1413335350742614067');
```
